I am a Lecturer in Robotics at School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Technology, University of Portsmouth (UoP), UK. Previously, I worked at [Shenyang Institute of Automation (SIA)](http://www.sia.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shenyang, China, and at [Italian Institute of Technology (IIT)](https://www.iit.it/our-research), Genova, Italy. I got my PhD degree in Mechatronics from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) in 2019.

My research interests focus on Robotic Systems, Human-Robot Interaction, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I am keen to apply these technologies to solve real-life problems. I am really fascinated by space, especially space robotics projects. I am building my own Lab (Human-AI-Robot Interaction Lab) at UoP now.

I am serving as an Associate Editor for [Frontiers in Robotics and AI](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai) and [Journal of Field Robotics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15564967).

Selected Research
=====
My research journey began with **Robotic Grasping** since my PhD research topic was about planning and control of space robots for grasping cooperative or non-cooperative objects in space. Then, I moved on to **Robotic Manipulation**, targeting robotic sampling (in space), polishing, and assembly, where the force interaction is the key point. In the first three years after I graduated with my PhD, I worked as a Project Manager/Leader in an industrial project --- [*Robotic Transformation of a Long-Boom Hydraulic Crane for Autonomous Transporting Heavy Loads*].

      <li>An energy-tank-based control framework is designed to incorporate control passivity into the mechanical passivity of the APUD for improving safety.</li>

Funding & Projects
======
Like many other Jekyll-based GitHub Pages templates, Academic Pages makes you separate the website's content from its form. The content & metadata of your website are in structured Markdown files, while various other files constitute the theme, specifying how to transform that content & metadata into HTML pages. You keep these various Markdown (.md), YAML (.yml), HTML, and CSS files in a public GitHub repository. Each time you commit and push an update to the repository, the [GitHub pages](https://pages.github.com/) service creates static HTML pages based on these files, which are hosted on GitHub's servers free of charge.

More info about configuring Academic Pages can be found in [the guide](https://academicpages.github.io/markdown/), the [growing wiki](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/wiki), and you can always [ask a question on GitHub](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/discussions). The [guides for the Minimal Mistakes theme](https://mmistakes.github.io/minimal-mistakes/docs/configuration/) (which this theme was forked from) might also be helpful.
