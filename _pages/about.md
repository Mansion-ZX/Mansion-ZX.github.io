I am a Lecturer in Robotics at School of Electrical and Mechanical Engineering, Faculty of Technology, University of Portsmouth (UoP), UK. Previously, I worked at [Shenyang Institute of Automation (SIA)](http://www.sia.cas.cn/), Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS), Shenyang, China, and at [Italian Institute of Technology (IIT)](https://www.iit.it/our-research), Genova, Italy. I got my PhD degree in Mechatronics from University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (UCAS) in 2019.

My research interests focus on Robotic Systems, Human-Robot Interaction, and Artificial Intelligence (AI). I am keen to apply these technologies to solve real-life problems. I am really fascinated by space, especially space robotics projects. I am building my own research line (Human-AI-Robot Interaction Group) at UoP now.

I am serving as an Associate Editor for [Frontiers in Robotics and AI](https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/robotics-and-ai) and [Journal of Field Robotics](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/journal/15564967).

Selected Research
=====
My research journey began with **Robotic Grasping** since my PhD research topic was about planning and control of space robots for grasping cooperative or non-cooperative objects. Then, I moved on to **Robotic Manipulation**, targeting robotic sampling (in space), polishing, and assembly, where the force interaction is the key point. In the first three years after I graduated with my PhD, I worked as a Project Manager/Leader in an industrial project --- [*Robotic Transformation of a Long-Boom Hydraulic Crane for Autonomous Transporting Heavy Loads*].

      <li>A cable-driven compliant gripper, designed to enable both soft docking and rigid locking, is integrated with an LBHR to create a heavy-load compliant grasping system.</li>
      <li>A vision-based multistep grasping strategy (VBMGS) is proposed to enable long-distance grasping. This strategy eliminates the need for hand-eye calibration and mitigates the adverse effects of kinematics uncertainty by incrementally guiding the grasping system toward the target object.</li>
      <li>A compensated incremental kinematics (CIK) method is embedded within the VBMGS to compute joint increments analytically, ensuring an accurate and incremental approach during the grasping process.</li>

      <ul>
      <li>A corrective shared control architecture with direct force-reflection is proposed to allow operators to deal with unexpected issues in polishing tasks, under which an intention-based collaborative polishing strategy is proposed to correct the polishing force.</li>
      <li>Based on the energy-awareness theory, a coupling energy scaling policy is designed between master and slave sides to regulate the transmission of both energy flows, which guarantees the passivity of the whole system and avoids contact instability caused by direct force-reflection.</li>
      <li>The direct force-reflection is employed in corrective shared control for the first time to facilitate operators perceiving the polishing force at the slave side, which allows for estimating human intention exactly.</li>
