**I believe that science and art are two sides of the same coin.** 

One of my favorite paintings---[What a Freedom!](https://rusmuseumvrm.ru/data/collections/painting/19_20/zh-2774/?lang=ru) This painting was created by a realist artist (Ilya Repin) in a state of romantic ecstasy in 1903.

My interpretation: Life is a journey, full of wind and waves, but we are the captains of our own ships. Embrace those who are brave and optimistic and enjoy this journey together:)
